Execution Guidelines
- Track progress with todo list tooling before starting each step.
- Keep communication concise; summarize tool output instead of pasting walls of text.
- Use the workspace root (.) for commands unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media/assets unless requested; call out placeholders clearly.
- Only install extensions if explicitly listed in project setup info.
- Do not describe folder structures unless user asks.
- Confirm with the user before launching dev servers or debuggers.
